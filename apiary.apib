2. After signing up [Get Your Access Token](#reference/authentication).
3. Understand our [Environments](#introduction/available-environments) setup.
4. Construct your REST API request, using our access-&-sign-up API reference documenation for existing API service domains [Shipping](#reference/shipping) and [Fulfillment](#reference/fulfillment).


## Available environments
DHL eCommerce provides **Production** environment as well as **Sandbox** for development and testing.<br/><br/> 
Access to both environments is managed and you have to use OAuth 2.0 `Access Token`, when accessing the API resources. <br/><br/>
Access Token could be requested via [Get Access Token API](#introduction/access-&-sign-up), where you have to provide your API credentials: `Client_ID` and `Client_Secret`. 

>**Note:** *You will have different identities for Production and Sandbox environment.*


### Sandbox
You can use the Sandbox environment for development and testing purpose.<br/><br/>
**Sandbox Base URL:** `https://api-qa.dhlecommerce.com`<br/><br/>
Sandbox provides the same APIs as Production environment. 
>**Note:** *The APIs exposed on Sandbox could be called directly from this documentation.*

For ease of access you can leverage the default API credentials:<br/>
 
`Client_id: e9ed82a8-4237-4185-8e36-47264aa9e718`

`Client_secret: b1ed1bfa-689b-4d5b-bbf2-39dde64ccb64`<br/>

which could be used to request Access Token for the Sandbox APIs. 

![TEST- or SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT](https://api-qa.dhlecommerce.com/apidoc/images/sandbox.png)
>**Note:** *Please have in mind that these credentials have more strict rate limits applied, therefore you can experience 429 HTTP Status code.*

### Production
For production purpose you have to use Production environment.<br/><br/>
**Production Base URL:** `https://api.dhlecommerce.com` <br/>

Production evironment hosts the same APIs as Sandbox, but with different base URL.

![PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT](https://api-qa.dhlecommerce.com/apidoc/images/prod.png)
>**Important note:** *Please keep in mind that Sandbox credentials does not apply for production environment and you have to use production set of credentials provided to you during onboarding.*

### Rate limits

For all API calls there is a rate limit applied.<br/><br/> 
Default limit is set to for each client to **5 requests** per second per API call. <br/><br/>
When the limit is reached you will recieve an HTTP Status code 429: Too many requests.

**HTTP Response Status Code 429**

````
{
"reasons": [{"msg" : "Too many requests in a given amount of time"}],
"details": {
            "msgId": "Id-135725589d........."

# Group Authentication

The API provides OAuth 2.0 Access Token with various authorization scopes. The Access Token can be used to authorize access for the DHL eCommerce Global APIs.

## Access Token [/v1/auth/accesstoken]

### Get Access Token [GET]

The Get Access Token API call provides OAuth 2.0 Bearer token with authorization scope, assigned to your client id, which will grants you an access to the Global DHL eCommerce APIs.

The API operation is secured by HTTP Basic authentication, therefore you have to provide **client_id** and **client_secret** as an username and password, when calling the API.

**Example:**
        
1. You will receive `client_id` and `client_secret` from DHL representative in following format.<br/>
Credentials bellow could be used in this Sandbox environment to get the Access Token.
    ````
    Client_id: e9ed82a8-4237-4185-8e36-47264aa9e718
    Client_secret: b1ed1bfa-689b-4d5b-bbf2-39dde64ccb64
    ````
2. When passing the `client_id` and `client_secret` via HTTPS request, using HTTP Basic authentication, you have to
populate HTTP Header Authorization in following format.

    > **Note:** *`Client_id` and `client_secret` has to be encoded in base64-encoding. There is a `space` characeter between Basic and the base64-encoded string. There is a `:` character between the client_id and client_secret, when encoded in base64-encoding.*
    
    ````
    Authorization: Basic base64-encoded(client_id:client_secret)
    Authorization: Basic ZTllZDgyYTgtNDIzNy00MTg1LThlMzYtNDcyNjRhYTllNzE4OmIxZWQxYmZhLTY4OWItNGQ1Yi1iYmYyLTM5ZGRlNjRjY2I2NA==
    ````
    > **Note:** *You can test the Get Access Token API directly from the documentation page. The Authorization HTTP Header was populated for you in the Console View on the right side of the screen.* 

3. You will receive following response in the JSON format.

    ````
      {
      "access_token": "FPOJnYACcqZV8YL5Vkm4Ae7nJMvWZDWOJBvD0rtM15BgttWgQEplsQ",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 18000,
      "scope": "efulfillment"
      }
    ````      
    
Understanding of the response fields:
  
`access_token:` Contains Access Token string for the Fulfillment API authentication and authorization.<br/><br/>

`token_type:` Type of the OAuth 2.0 access token. Default value is "Bearer".<br/><br/>

`expires_in:` Time to live of the access token. Default value is 18000 seconds / 5 hours. After this time the token expires. <br/><br/>

`scope:` Authorization scope of access token. Default value for Fulfillment API is "efulfillment". Could contain multiple scope values, which will be separated by space character.<br/><br/>

# Group Fulfillment
The Fulfillment API provides you an interface for the order management operations.

**API Authentication:** All API operations require `Access Token` to be passed in the Authorization Header for each request. The token type is an OAuth 2.0 Bearer token.<br/><br/> 
>**Note:** *[here](#reference/authentication) you can find more information how to to retrive the `Access Token`.* 

**Access Token Lifecycle:** When you recieve an Access Token, it is valid for defined amount of time (5h).<br/><br/> 
During this time you don't have to request new token per each request, but you can simply reuse the same token to access API resources, until the token expires.<br/><br/> 
The invalid token or token expiration will be indicated by HTTP Status Code 401 Unauthorized, then your application has to request new Access Token.

**API Parameters:** The parameters could be mandatory, optional and conditionally-optional. The conditionally-optional parameters are marked as optional parameters, where at least one or a combination has to be part of the API call. <br/><br/>
The specific list of conditionally-optional parameters will be highlighted in a table in each particular API operation section.

# Group Shipping
Our global shipping API provides you with everything you need to bring your orders to your customers - for your domestic- as well as for your international ones.<br/><br/>
Starting with receiving shipping options via label creation and manifesting of your shipments to ensure a smooth handover to the creation of tracking updates - all within one API. 
You can use Shipping API for the Order Manifest and Label generation (PDF, PNG and ZPL formats).<br/><br/>


**API Authentication:** All API operations require `Access Token` to be passed in the Authorization Header for each request. The token type is an OAuth 2.0 Bearer token.<br/><br/> 
>**Note:** *[here](#reference/authentication) you can find more information how to to retrive the `Access Token`.* 

The Access Token is valid for 5h so it is not necessary to request the token for each request. Developers should implement the client application in a way that the token will be requested again only after it expires.

To use the Shipping calls, you may use the following accounts and additional settings.

## Label [/shipping/v1/label{?format,labelSize,pageSize,layout}]

Now that you know the shipping product you want to use, you can use the API calls described here to create the labels you need for this.<br/><br/>
No matter if they are domestic labels, labels for your international shipments or if it is a postal or a commercial shipment - here you will receive them all.<br/><br/>
Furthermore, by creation of the shipping label you will receive a unique tracking code for your customer that is bound to the label you created.<br/><br/>


### Create Label [POST]

Purpose of this service is to generate labels for single mail item only (single package object).<br/><br/>
The benefit of this service is that it is synchronous and returns label contents directly in the response, so it is no necessity to download the labels afterwards.<br/><br/>

___

Recommended sequence for the Label service call is following:
        
1. Use clientId to obtain token using the authentication API - see `API Authentication` description above.
2. Prepare valid JSON request document per schema. Use data above depending on your use-case.
3. Call Sandbox API. The response message will contain information form the request; additionally it may contain a tracking number (depending on product) and base64-encoded label.

## Order Manifest [/shipping/v1/order/manifest]
**Manifesting** (sometimes refered to as *Close-out*) describes the process of transmitting your final shipments to us before the physical transfer of the shipments.<br/><br/>
Within this process, a document (**the Manifest**) is beeing created sumarizing all the to be shipped items, their total weight as well as associated information on your account.<br/><br/>
The created document also includes your signature and a barcode. During drop-off or pick-up, this document is scanned by us.<br/><br/>

### Create Manifest [POST]
Purpose of this service is to create shipping order manifest.<br/><br/>
The shipping order manifest (SOM) API uses the same document format / JSON schema like Label service.<br/><br/> 
It does allow transmission of data for up to 1000 parcels in a single call.<br/><br/>
The recommended sequence for the SOM call is following:

    1. Use client id to obtain token using the authentication API- see `API Authentication` description above.
    
    2. Prepare valid JSON request document per schema. Use data above depending on your use-case.
    
    3. Call Sandbox API. The response message will acknowledge success or failure of the call.
